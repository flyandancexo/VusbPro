# VusbPro - High Speed USBasp
## VusbPro is the enhanced V-USB, a software-based USB device using an AVR MCU

The V-usb project was under maintenance for about a decade, and over that period, different projects had been created with different levels of incomprehensible code and incompetence. VusbPro is an attempt to fix it and making V-usb more accessible with rewritten and more well commented examples. V-usb is a very under-rated project and it can be very useful if it can be easily used by hobbyist and professional alike. 

Beside rewriting all the code from V-usb and creating few new project examples, the snail slow USBasp will be updated with a guarantee 10kB/s write and 15kB/s read speed, and the USBaspbootloader will be updated to make it more user-friendly, and with auto-upload capability. 

This is a long and complicated endeavour, so any support is very welcomed. Do donate whatever amount that you are comfortable with.
